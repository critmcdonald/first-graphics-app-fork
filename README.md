### Contributing

The documentation for this site is published via [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) and controlled by the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) configuration and [reStructured Text](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) files in the `readthedocs` directory. An edit there followed by push to the master branch on GitHub will trigger the docs being redeployed to [www.firstgraphics.app](http://www.firstgraphics.app).
